            <h3>Skills and experience</h3>
            <p class="p1">I have some basic HTML and CSS skills, which enable me to work on simple web projects.
                In my free time, I've also built my own PC, which was a practical exercise in hardware and software assembly.
                These endeavors have given me a solid foundation in these areas.</p>
            <p class="p1">When i was working at a company called Nextron,
                I worked in a capacity where I was responsible for assembling PCs and servers.
                It was a job that demanded precision and attention to detail as I put together different hardware components to create functional computing systems.
                Whether it was assembling PCs or configuring server systems for businesses, my role at Nextron provided valuable experience in hardware assembly.
                It was a job that taught me the importance of teamwork and customer satisfaction in delivering quality tech solutions. Overall,
                my time at Nextron was a significant learning experience in the field of computing.</p>
            <p class="p3">Here you can see the different servers i made while i was working there</p>
